# Advent of Code: solutions in Swift

This repository contains my solutions for [advent of code challenges](https://adventofcode.com).

Every task has its own page in the playground, as well as the input which is stored in the resources.
Sometimes for heavy computatons the solution is moved to sources folder.

If you interested in C++ solutions, visit my other repo: [nikolay-pv/advent-of-code-cpp](https://github.com/nikolay-pv/advent-of-code-cpp).
